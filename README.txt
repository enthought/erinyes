Erinyes
=======

``Erinyes`` is a stress and gui testing module that extends the python
unittest framework.


Structure
=========

The code is organised into test assistant mixing classes that are divided
into two groups.

Stress
------

Supports testing an algorithm or part of it to verify that multiple runs will
not result in memory errors.

Application
-----------

Supports a very basic external testing of applications to check behaviour while
they run on a separate process.
